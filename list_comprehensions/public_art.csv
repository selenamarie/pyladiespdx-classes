With a background in figurative painting, he pursued the exploration of mood, thought, and feeling through abstract works. His abstract paintings were generally based on nature, poetry, scenery, and his never ending curiosity.  Among his many accomplishments, he and his wife, Hilda Morris, received the prestigious Governor's Art Award in Oregon in 1985.

Abstract Expressionism often describes a general attitude rather than a set of concrete facts and artists working in this style generally place great value on spontaneous improvisation and individuality.  Their work may appear to have been created by accident or chance, but it is always thoughtful and can even be highly planned.","http://data.racc.org/pa_inventory/0286/0286thumb.jpg","http://racc.org/public-art/search/?recid=470.135","2010-02-18 00:00:00"

The mural is a culmination of nearly twenty years of historical research and constitutes a powerful tribute to the generations of courageous people who rose from slavery, endured the hardships of the westward journey, and contributed importantly to the settling of the West. The word ""Bilalian,"" used in the title, is synonymous for ""African American"" and has connotations of courage and strong faith associated with Bilal, the first minister of Islam. The word Odyssey, derived from Homer's poem, suggests virtue and perseverance on an epic scale.

As an African American youth growing up in Portland in the '50s and as an art student at Portland State University in the early '60s, Isaac Shamsud-Din had been frustrated by the lack of information available to him about his cultural heritage. Following his experiences in 1965 as a civil rights activist in Stuttgart, Arkansas, he determined to redress the situation by devoting his life and his art to the preservation and promotion of African American culture.

It has long been considered a seminal piece in the City of Portland's public art collection, and in 2010 was saved from potential deaccession by a careful restoration addressing problems with its structural stability. 

Lee Kelly is a prolific sculptor whose influential work can be found throughout Portland and the Pacific Northwest. Born in Idaho, he attended the Portland Art Museum School in the fifties and has worked and taught in the Portland region for decades. Kelly describes his sculptural process as putting the energy of Abstract Expression into three dimensional form. 

Kelly's wife, Bonnie Bronson, was a well-known Northwest artist before her tragic death in a climbing accident in 1990. She was known for her geometric two dimensional steel and enameled collages she referred to as ""modulars."" The beautiful red-orange tiles in this piece provide an excellent example of her mastery of enamel created through an industrial process that she herself developed in 1973.","http://data.racc.org/pa_inventory/0650/0650thumb.jpg","http://racc.org/public-art/search/?recid=787.201","2012-02-29 00:00:00"

Gillman designed the sculpture to create a space where people could sit and have quiet time. In his work, he uses the nature of the stone to create a feeling of space and time, juxtaposing natural, manmade, and architectural elements to remind of us of man's place in nature. The following poem was chosen by Gillman to be displayed alongside the finished work.     

Let us be ""Called...by the hopes of children 
to a world of endless wheat and barley sugar...
whatever--the skies now lifted
and the poppies bloomed
and the men and women fed the children 
and the long long lives of elders
kept the history green.""

The totem was carved during Oregon's Centennial in 1959, to celebrate the state's role in Operation Deep Freeze, which established a scientific station at the geographic South Pole.

Born Cherokee, Lelooska (1933-1996) was adopted into the Kwakwaka'wakw, and was known for his mastery of storytelling and carving. As a scholar and educator, Lelooska was an authority on the Indians of North America with a particular emphasis on the tribes of the Northwest coastal region.

Scott's unique, direct, and often dogmatic writing style was greatly influential in regional politics. He shaped the Oregonian's conservative perspective on such issues as women's suffrage, the labor movement, and publicly funded schools. His skill as a journalist and editor brought the Oregonian national recognition. Scott was also an intense enthusiast of the Pacific Northwest, proclaiming the ""greatness"" of the region during his national travels.

""Harvey W. Scott"" was sculpted in 1930 during the same period that Gutzon Borglum was working on Mt. Rushmore.

The sculpture was commissioned after Roosevelt's death as a memorial to what he had come to symbolize to an America that was emerging from its wild past as a world power. At the outbreak of the Spanish American War in 1898, Roosevelt recruited men, many of whom were former college athletes and Western cowboys, to join a cavalry regiment. They were called The Rough Riders. They fought against the Spanish in Cuba, winning fame for their charge up San Juan Hill. 

Proctor is a celebrated American sculptor known for his sculptures of cowboys and animals of the American West, subject matter that during his lifetime was romanticized in Europe and in high-demand. Proctor grew up in Colorado and was as passionate about hunting as he was about art. Like Dr. Henry Waldo Coe, he also was a hunting partner of Roosevelt's. Proctor took great care in accurately depicting Roosevelt as a symbol of American determination, success, and strength and as a bridge back to the Wild West. Cast in Brooklyn NY, apropos to the part Roosevelt had in the acquirement and development of the Panama Canal, the sculpture was shipped on this route by sea rather than by land to avoid cutting the sculpture into sections to come by rail. Vice President Coolidge was present at the sculpture's groundbreaking.","http://data.racc.org/pa_inventory/0659/0659thumb.jpg","http://racc.org/public-art/search/?recid=1192.182","2012-02-28 00:00:00"

In my studio, there are all sorts of seeds, leaves and plant stems floating around.

In creating pieces for the Midland Library, I designed cast stone medallions for the north and south walls of the buildings exterior.   I wished to link the library to the small park next to it.  I wanted the work to be bold shapes that could be viewed as one walked by, but also could be understood from a distance.

I began thinking of different shapes; an x, a spiral, a diagonal ellipse.  At the same time, I was gathering leaves.  I started making many small models in clay.  Eventually I chose to sculpt native northwest leaves: rhododendron, fern, dogwood, maple and alder.  After I selected these five forms I created more specific models.  At the time, I was learning to paint egg tempera, so I made studies using this technique.

A wooden box ""frame"" was constructed; this would be the size and shape of the final piece and would house the modeled clay leaf.  As a piece was shaped, I would periodically move it outdoors and orient it toward the South, so I could get a sense of shadow at different times of the day. 

From the wood and clay model, a rubber mold was mad.  These were then transported out to the casting company, where they were filled with a cast stone mix which had been specified by the architect.  The pieces were bundled and trucked to this site.  The medallions were paired in different combinations and installed by some very strong brick masons.","http://data.racc.org/pa_inventory/1149/1149thumb.jpg","http://racc.org/public-art/search/?recid=1324.172","2010-07-19 00:00:00"

The work is the second oldest sculpture located in the Portland metropolitan area. It was created in the horse and buggy era of Portland and would have originally been used as a place to rest and water horses. Over time Portlanders have become quite proud of this landmark sculpture.

Roland Perry (1870-1941)  was an accomplished American sculptor and painter. He studied at The Ecole des Beaux Arts in New York and at the Academies Julian and  Delecluse in Paris.

I made a progression using local basalt stone and the existing wrecked concrete.

At the top of the berm there is a grouping of saw-cut vertical basalt, and some irregular, displaced foundations.  As the basalt pieces progress from berm to river, they tip over, so that the concrete below becomes exposed and the basalt becomes submerged and eventually disappears.

At the river path there are various configurations of concrete and stone, including inlays and pieces that can function as seating.  Concrete is cut in various places to expose the river rock aggregate inside as well as the old embedded wood piers, and some heavy steel reinforcement emerges in various plant-like and root-like ways.

""This work is about the American landscape, most notably, the roadside signs, which dot the streets and are meant to be seen at a certain rate of speed.

When we slow down, they no longer make sense; their ability to communicate is dependent upon our quick glance.  These collages are all made from cut and reassembled signs.  They seem recognizable at first, yet lose all information upon viewing.  I am interested in the new communication that is formed in their familiar but unreadable symbols. 

Composition and craftsmanship are two characteristics in artwork that I admire.  I feel that my education, first as a jeweler and later as a fiber artist, not only taught me the respect necessary for this current method of working, but was also instrumental in directing my aesthetic decisions.""","http://data.racc.org/pa_inventory/1262a/1262athumb.jpg","http://racc.org/public-art/search/?recid=1675.164","2012-03-05 00:00:00"

Referring to the myth of Theseus defeating the minotaur, the crucial golden thread is represented by a winding trail of an inlaid brass strip and text in brass letters.  The text is a list of Portland neighborhood associations which proceeds through the halls and corridors of the first floor before entering the maze and finding its way to the center.  At the center, lies a single, white rose outlined in brass.  As a reward for persistence, it represents our goal of a livable city.

The seal depicts a wilderness scene including mountains, forest, and the sea with Lady Commerce in the foreground holding a trident in her right hand. Together, these figures symbolize the origins of the city, its culture, agrarian base, and industry.  

Michael Graves, the architect for the Portland Building, suggested a statue of Lady Commerce as part of his design for the building.  Raymond J. Kaskey, a Washington, D.C. sculptor, won the commission through the City's Percent for Art program.  The sculpture is made of hammered copper sheeting about the thickness of a dime formed around a steel armature, and took three years to complete. She is 1/3 the size of the Statue of Liberty, the only larger statue of this kind in the nation. 
 
Portlandia was shipped across the country by rail in eight pieces. After being assembled in a local shipyard, she rode by river barge and truck to her final destination, welcomed by thousands of Portland residents along the riverbank, streets, and bridges.  Her dedication to the citizens of Portland on October 8, 1985, confirmed her acceptance as a new symbol of the city.

As a kid I would go for walks with my father and he would point things out to me. He seemed interested in everything?""an architectural detail, an old tree, a geological formation, a historical monument, an unusual shop or restaurant. Features otherwise hidden to me would be revealed and made significant while spending time with him.

Over the past eight years I have worked on projects exploring the dynamics of social spaces, communities, and environments. These projects have taken the form of installations, publications, educational activities, and public art pieces and have involved a variety of populations: middle school students in Oakland, office workers from the City of Richmond, local residents from the Sunset District in San Francisco, students living in dorms at the University of Washington, shoppers at a mall in Pleasanton, urban gardeners in the Mission District of San Francisco, among others.

My project for the Streetcar Alignment brings together my early memories of walks with my father, photography, and my involvement with community based art projects. To do this I will install a series of solar powered lights on motion sensors to literally highlight aspects of the neighborhoods that the streetcar will be running through. The units would be attached to pre-existing street car poles and operate from dusk to late evening. It's evident that these neighborhoods already have cultural and aesthetic qualities that define them.  

The idea draws strictly on what the various neighborhoods along the alignment already have?""unusual architecture, old signs, specific trees, old fire hydrants and infrastructure, etc. I will choose several locations to just light a circular spot on the sidewalk that a person could walk into and for a moment stand out for their own visual or gestural significance. In a way, the lights would act as real time photographs of interesting aspects in Portland's nighttime urban environment.","http://data.racc.org/pa_inventory/1498/1498thumb.jpg","http://racc.org/public-art/search/?recid=2183.147","2011-05-17 00:00:00"

Still existing today are many artifacts of marine architecture both old and new, most of which are made from large diameter logs driven into the river bottom and sometimes lashed together with cables.  Cast in rammed earth molds, the Wapato sculpture makes a somewhat ironic connection between the indigenous marine structures held up by the river bottom and the Wapato site which is made out of river bottom.  Specifically, the Wapato sculpture refers to ""dolphins"" used to mark obstructions and provide mooring facilities for boats, and form of  a boat ""in ruin"" which creates a kind of enclosure surrounded by the orchard trees.

The work was designed to resemble a European town square, littered with the remnants of a family forced to flee home. From the town square a walkway leads to a large wall featuring the memories of holocaust survivors living in Oregon and the names of relatives lost to Oregonians.

Some of the individual details are carved to suggest that artifacts are embedded within the granite base blocks and plinths. Drawn from extensive research, the content of the detail carvings symbolize one or more of the following subjects: a people of common cultural identity, a place in time, historic uses of nearby structures. For example, the southern sculpture on the 3rd and Davis plinth recalls artifacts from Japantown which stood on that location until the ""relocation"" of Japanese-Americans in 1942, while the north sculpture on 3rd and Flanders pays homage to the building of Portland's rail systems, historic and contemporary.

As I considered ways in which humans mark pathways, I thought of cairns, those man-made stacks of stones that mark hiking trails and which historically have served as landmarks for land and sea navigation, memorials, and commemorative markers. Travelers on cross-country trails traditionally add stones to cairns as they pass, resulting in animated and precarious stacks of rocks and pebbles. This evidence of human comings and goings, these reminders that others have followed the same path signify safety and reassurance out in the wilderness. In the urban wilderness, finding one's way through the various stages of hurry-up-and-wait are just as significant. These stand-alone works speak to the step-by-step marking of time, and incorporate varying degrees of elegance and playfulness. They are related to each other through this thematic underpinning and through the use of stone, but each responds to its site in its own way.

The legend goes like this: ever since Portland's founding there have been sightings of small green archers. Whenever the archer hits someone her vision changes: flowers grow from the heads of passerby, a building called ""The Greenwood"" appears where there was no building before, and a giant tree towers over the city. On certain nights a great white celestial stag is spied in the skies over Portland.

The piece has two components. There are two sculpture and eight ""story markers"" told as a poem over ten blocks of Old Town and Chinatown. The images in the panels combine the visual language of seventies horror comics and WPA posters. Pedestrians and riders come upon the story in fragments based on their routes through the neighborhood.

The neighborhood has a layered, rich history. The legend encompasses all the varied, transitory communities that call that neighborhood home. My hope is that it twines itself into the fabric of the community.","http://data.racc.org/pa_inventory/1863a-j/1863a-jthumb.jpg","http://racc.org/public-art/search/?recid=2872.96","2011-10-27 00:00:00"

The cast bronze figures of Burls Will be Burls represent what might happen when a snowman melts and nourishes a nearby living tree. Water is absorbed by the roots and carries the spirit of the melted snowman up into the tree where it manifests itself as burls.

Lodge grass is also the name for a range of plants used by indigenous peoples to make shelters. As the environment has evolved and useful plants such as lodge grass have disappeared, the thistle and other noxious weeds have replaced them, in the same way that wilderness areas have been replaced by suburban developments.

In this sculpture the artist has substituted symbols and imagery for the figure's head and shoulders. One form is an abstract shape suggesting a teepee reflected in water. The other more dominant form is that of a thistle, the first plant to pop back up after you've cleared the land.

Above the Grandmother's mask sits a coastal bird, the Killdeer. This legendary mothering bird distracts predators approaching the nest by acting wounded and hobbling away.

Representing the struggles of parenthood, a pair of salmon circle a burden basket. Salmon endure great hardships and eventually give up their own lives to have children. A lamprey eel feeds on the male salmon, showing us the naturally occurring interdependence of species.

Peering out of the burden basket is a smiling infant modeled after the artist's daughter, Lily. The sculpture started out expressing the difficult circumstances and troubled life of single parents, often grandparents stepping in to raise a child. But when Bartow placed Lily in the basket it became a hopeful, encouraging and optimistic work

The standing figure is a stylized version of a strong female in both a classical and minimal form. The watching dog acts as a counterbalance to the female figure and is the friendly canine companion that is so much a part of our popular culture.

The act of combining these forms in new, perhaps unexpected, ways presented interesting problems to Gander as an object maker. He equates the act of solving these problems to basic human tendencies: searching for meaning, significance and understanding.

Just as puzzles rely on clues and speculations for their resolutions, Puzzle Tower invites viewers to make connections?""to speculate and find meaningful personal references from something unknown or unfamiliar. It's the artist's hope they will equate this experience to the act of thinking and resolving.

The designated location for the work was unusual in that it encompassed the outdoor spaces of the Hotel Modera as well as the adjoining sidewalk. For the artist, the material and the site presented both opportunities and challenges. In particular, he wanted to create relationships between the multiple pieces while allowing each piece to stand on its own.

For the concept, Kosuge began by studying the stones, which were relatively small and with curved edges. Their size and shape were central in determining what the final work would look like.

The resulting five sculptures involve interconnecting visual elements that include repetition, tension and stability. Hopefully, each viewer will have a unique opportunity to enjoy the pieces from different perspectives and to understand the relationship of the sculptural shapes to one another.

A professor there told me that one problem humans have in addressing environmental problems is our limited ability to perceive at different scales. Many important things are simply too small or too large for us to comprehend. This made me think it would be valuable to reveal some hidden phenomenon, in particular the beautiful single-celled organisms used to evaluate water quality in urban streams.

Twelve oversized diatoms carved in granite are sited in the biofiltration strips unique to the the southern portion of the transit mall. Placing them in the water filtration strips adds a supporting layer of content to the landscape.Unbeknownst to me, the project was recently shown as part of a presentation at the North American Diatom Symposium, delighting the audience of scientists.

With Urban Hydrology, I tried to thread the needle between beauty, abstraction and content to appeal to both academic and casual viewers.

Although the mill is no longer there, the Central Eastside continues to have a vibrant commercial and industrial component that mixes residential, recreation, and business.

Throughout the image are several series of local mountains, bridges, gardens, parks, icons of communities, and city workers behind the scenes to keep the city-Goldberg-machine functioning.
